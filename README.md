# Stock-Price-Prediction

1. First, we will learn how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural network.
2. Then we will build a dashboard using Plotly dash for stock analysis.

# We will solve it by:

1. Reading and analyzing data. (Pandas)
2. Normalizing the data. (SkLearn)
3. Converting data to time-series and supervised learning problem.
4. Creating model (Keras)
5. Training, predicting and visualizing the result.

#  Long Short-Term Memory.

We will be using LSTM for this task, which is a variation of Recurrent Neural Network.

LSTMs are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because theyâ€™re able to store past information. This is important in our case because the previous price of a stock is crucial in predicting its future price

# Build the dashboard using Plotly dash

Dash is a python framework that provides an abstraction over flask and react.js to build analytical web applications.

Before moving ahead, you need to install dash. Run the below command in the terminal.

Then make a new python file stock_app.py (or whatever you want to name it) and paste the script
